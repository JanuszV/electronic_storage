# Description 📋
This project is a GUI with a database for my electronic collection so I wouldn't need to search through my box to see what I got.
# Functionality ⚙
Database contains data about type of electronic element, it part number, value if needed, quantity i got and note that can be any text even a hiperlink to a datasheet.
User can add new items, add and delete quantity of an element or even delete whole element existance.
# Python 🐍 - Version: 3.11.5
# Used libraries 📚
PyQt5 📊 - Version: 5.15.9, 
sqlite3 📰 - Version: 3.41.2, 
pandas 🐼 - Version: 2.1.0
# Note 📝
I also created a .bat file that will execute the code from Desktop and Virtual Enviroment in Anaconda so the accesability for this app is higher. 
I didn't create an executable file because it would be too much for such small project
